## Summary
Today's flipped class lesson focuses on the types of database users and roles of database administrator which is one the database users. Before starting flipped class, we were divided into four groups and Miss Palden Ongmo Lhendup(Module Tutor) assigned two topics. One topic for first two groups and another topic for last two groups. Our topic was "types of database users". At this time we all were famaliar with the term "database" and were able to understand the types of database users easily. We started discussing on the first type of database user which is Naive user also called Parametric End user. Naive users are the user who don't have any knowledge of DBMS(Database Management System). Second type of database user is System Analyst. A person who helps managing data for an organization and also checks all the requirement for Naive user. The third one is Sophicated user, like scientist, engineer, etc... They are the one who have high level of knowledge of databse. Fourth one is the users who design the structure of databse is called database designer. Database designer fulfill the needs of the database user type. Fifth one is Casual/Temporary user who use database rarely to do their task. Sixth one is Specialized user who writes specialized database application. And the last one is database Administrator who manages overall database management system. From types of database users I understood that different type of database user have different level of DBMS. After discussing about the types of database user we were regrouped into another group who were having different topic to share our understanding. We started sharing what we have discussed in previous group and they continued. They shared the roles and responsibility of database administrator(one of the database user type). Database Administrator are the the one who maintain policies to keep database secure. DBAs are the one to design and organize the data efficiently so that everyone can find it easily. If there is any problem with database they are the one to handle the problem. They have backup plan to recover lost data and keep everything working smothly. These are the basic roles of Database administrator and importance of their role that I have learned from my friends.

In the flipped class we were divided into four group, assigned with two different topics which is "Types fo Database Users" and " Roles and Responsiblities of Database Administrators". Two group discssued on one topic and another two groups discussed another topic. After 20 minites we formed another 4 groups to share what we have discussed in previous group. After discussion there was question and answer session.

Flipped class can be improved by doing more question answer session and sharing what we have learned. Sometimes instead of doing question answer we and conduct small quiz so that student can learn more by interacting.
