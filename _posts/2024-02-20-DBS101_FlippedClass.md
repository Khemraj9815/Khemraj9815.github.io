### Sumarry
Today's flipped class lesson focus on modeling basic Entity-relationship diagram where it required lots of past concept to model it. I could imagine basic diagram of ER diagram but not the perfect one, which could contain all necessary component in it. When it comes to application part of any topic that we have learned, it made lots of sense when we were doing practical or group activities.

We were divided into six groups with four members in each group. We were provided with topic "Airline Ticketing", with this topic we have to model a Entity-Relationship diagram. Were given 1 hour to complete the task and another 1 hour to present our work to the class. while doing group activities with my group member they had differet ways of presenting their work which made much sense to me when it came practical life. After we were done with doing our assigned task we presented our work and give them comment to their work. We were given feedback by our module tutor, where we have gone wrong and where we need to be improved. Class ends with good feedback which made me feel I have learn something in this class.

Today's class was interesting and in future I wish to do similar activities with my friends and wish to do different activities. Giving feedback to us would be the most important thing to correct our work and to motivate us to learn more.
