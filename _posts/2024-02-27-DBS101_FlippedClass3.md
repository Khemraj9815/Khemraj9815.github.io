### Summary

Today's flipped class content was less to discuss. It was on set operation of SQL where it is used to combine multiple table to get desired table and the null value. SQL set operation will be implemented only if the table have same number of columns and that corresponding columns must have same data type. So it's important to compare the data type and number of column before implementing SQL set operation. A null represents the absence value for unknown data/lost data.

We were divided into 4 groups with two topics. First two groups was given first topic and another topic for remaining groups. Since th etopic was simple it didn't take much time to discuss with group mate. After certain period we grouped into expert group to share what we have discussed in home group.
